title: Narrative summarization with integrated perception, interpretation, and text generation
abstract: Answering the question _What happened?_ requires the interplay of perception, interpretation, and language production capabilities. Recent progress in the areas of automated perception and text generation give some hope that a robust narrative summarization pipeline is on the horizon. However, a deeper understanding of the central process of interpretation is needed, along with an understanding of the role that it plays in an integrated system. In this invited talk I will describe recent work on generating narrative summaries of events in multiplayer virtual simulations, which advances our previous work on narrative summarization as applied to the classic Heider-Simmel film.
